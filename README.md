# Backend Solution Overview

This backend solution is built with .NET and is structured into several projects, each with its own responsibility. The main projects are Controllers, Entities, and Services.

## Controllers

The Controllers project contains the API endpoints for the application. Each controller corresponds to a specific route and is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. The controllers use services to perform business logic and interact with the database.

For example, the ChallengeController is responsible for managing challenges. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving challenges.

## Services

The Services project contains the business logic of the application. Each service corresponds to a specific domain of the application and provides methods for performing operations related to that domain.

For instance, the ChallengeService provides methods for managing challenges, such as creating a new challenge, updating an existing challenge, deleting a challenge, and retrieving challenges. It uses the IAppDbContext to interact with the database, the IUserService to manage users, and the IChallengeCodeGenerator to generate challenge codes.

## Entities

The Entities project contains the database context and the entity models for the application. The entity models represent the tables in the database and the relationships between them.

## Docker

This solution can be run in a Docker container. The docker-compose.yaml file in the root directory defines the services that make up your app in Docker, which includes a service for the app itself and services for any dependencies such as databases.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store sensitive information for your application. These are stored in the .env file in the root directory of your project. This file should not be checked into source control.

# Running the Solution

To run the solution, you need to have .NET installed on your machine. You can then use the `dotnet run` command in the root directory of the solution.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please make sure to write tests for your changes and follow the existing coding style.
